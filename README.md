# js-deobfuscator

A powerful Python script to **de-obfuscate JavaScript** code, primarily aimed at decoding encoded or obfuscated JavaScript used in platforms like **Tampermonkey** and similar environments. This tool is designed to help analyze and reverse-engineer obfuscated code that is often used to hide malicious or harmful behavior in JavaScript scripts.

## Why This Tool Exists

In environments like **Tampermonkey**, **GreaseMonkey**, and similar user script managers, itâ€™s common for JavaScript code to be **encoded** or **obfuscated** to hide its true intent. This is often done to:

- **Induce harmful or malicious code**: Obfuscation can make it harder to detect malicious actions by hiding the true nature of the script.
- **Maintain intransparency**: Obfuscation is often used to make the code less readable and more difficult for analysts to reverse-engineer or audit.
